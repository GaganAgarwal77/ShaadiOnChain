# ShaadiOnChain

Weddings in India are regarded to be an everlasting love relationship. ShaadiOnChain now allows you to record your love for the rest of your life.

Many Indian couples have begun to celebrate and register their weddings on the blockchain, although this can be difficult for those who are unfamiliar with web3.

Our platform provides a simple interface for couples to enjoy a fully loaded love journey on the blockchain.

There are numerous options available on our platform that will assist you in your love life: 

- Dating - Match with random individuals. Accept or reject them based on the NFTs they possess. 
    
- Love Letters - Send love letters to users whom you have matched with or know of. Love letters are dynamic NFTs. They are blank pages that dynamically update once you write on them. 
    
- Rings Marketplace - Users can buy rings as NFTs from designers or companies to deliver with their engagement proposals. Designers have the option of minting and selling their rings on the marketplace. This offers them a source of income.
    
- Engagement Proposal - Take the next step and send your love the engagement ring along with a heartfelt note of love. The proposee could accept the proposal and return a ring with their note. Don't be disheartened if your proposal is rejected.
    
- Marriage Proposal - The pinnacle of your love journey. Consider the decision carefully, but once you've decided, it's just a matter of a few clicks on our platform. Send your marriage vows along with the proposal, and they will be saved on the blockchain forever.
    
- If your partner agrees to the marriage, you will both receive :
    - Marriage certificate- Proof of your marriage that will endure forever and cannot be altered.
    - Tree NFT - Growing evolutionary dynamic NFT. Our goal is to plant a tree for every NFT so that the tree grows with the growing love not just on the blockchain, but also in our real world.
